# Physics Pipeline

## Purpose

This is an old project created for a research project during my time as a Physics undergraduate, and is now archived.

This is a data pipeline that takes in `.csv`, and outputs best-fit statistics using gnuplot. The bash script allows for the processing of multiple `.csv` files in batches.
